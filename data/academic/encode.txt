A third likely explanation for infantile amnesia involves incompatibilities between the ways in which infants encode information and the ways in which older children and adults retrieve it.
General knowledge of categories of events such as a birthday party or a visit to the doctor's office helps older individuals encode their experiences, but again, infants and toddlers are unlikely to encode many experiences within such knowledge structures.
Hearing the stories may lead preschoolers to encode aspects of events that allow them to form memories they can access as adults.
Motifs of seeming simplicity can encode complex meanings in Aboriginal Australia.
