A conspicuous sign indicating the presence of white-tailed deer in a woodlot is a buck rub.
A male deer makes a buck rub by stripping the bark (outer layer) of a small tree with its antlers.
When completed, the buck rub is an obvious visual signal to us and presumably to other deer in the area.
A rub is usually located at the shoulder height of a deer (one meter or less above the ground) on a smooth-barked, small-diameter (16-25 millimeters) tree.
However, biologists also noted that deer sniff and lick an unfamiliar rub, which suggests that this visual mark on a small tree plays an important communication purpose in the social life of deer.
Buck rubs also have a scent produced by glands in the foreheads of deer that is transferred to the tree when the rub is made.
It was found that when a white-tailed buck makes a rub, it moves both antlers and forehead glands along the small tree in a vertical direction.
First, the chemicals deposited on the rub provide information on the individual identity of an animal; no two mammals produce the same scent.
Second, because only male deer rub, the buck rub and its associated chemicals indicate the sex of the deer producing the rub.
Third, older, more dominant bucks produce more buck rubs and probably deposit more glandular secretions on a given rub.
The information conveyed by the olfactory signals on a buck rub make it the social equivalent of some auditory signals in other deer species, such as trumpeting by bull elk.
Thus, like a buck rub, a scrape is both a visual and an olfactory signal.
