Learning appropriate social behaviors is especially important in species that live in groups, like young monkeys that need to learn to control selfishness and aggression and to understand the give-and-take involved in social groups.
They need to learn how to be dominant and submissive because each monkey might have to play either role in the future.
A successful translocation exercise also appears to have been achieved with red howler monkeys in French Guiana.
Released troops of monkeys were kept under visual observation and followed by radio tracking of 16 females.
