Great Britain had large amounts of coal; however, there were not yet efficient means by which to produce mechanical energy or to power machinery.
Water was the main source of mechanical power, and by the end of the seventeenth century, England alone is thought to have had some 20,000 working mills.
In Europe, before the introduction of the mechanical clock, people told time by sun (using, for example, shadow sticks or sun dials) and water clocks.
Society needed a more dependable instrument of time measurement and found it in the mechanical clock. 
But the mechanical clock kept equal hours, and this implied a new time reckoning.
The clock was the greatest achievement of medieval mechanical ingenuity.
They were thus the pioneers of mechanical engineering and served as examples and teachers to other branches of engineering.
Cyrus McCormick refined a mechanical reaper that harvested fourteen times more wheat with the same amount of labor.
Coal was not used, however, to produce mechanical energy or to power machinery.
The jaw joint of carnivores such as dogs and cats has the mechanical advantage of being at the same level as the tooth row, allowing the jaws to close with tremendous speed and forcing the upper teeth to occlude against the lower teeth with great precision.
