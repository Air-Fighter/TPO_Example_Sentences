The brain  s level of physiological maturation may support these types of memories, but not ones requiring explicit verbal descriptions. 
Telling such stories to two year olds does not seem to produce long-lasting verbalizable memories.
Older children and adults often try to retrieve the names of things they saw, but infants would not have encoded the information verbally.
Because they cannot verbalize or fill out questionnaires, indirect techniques of naturalistic observation are used as the primary means of determining what infants can see, hear, feel, and so forth.
According to this line of thought, the verbal abilities that blossom in the two year old allow events to be coded in a form radically different from the action-based codes of the infant.
When researchers had one year olds imitate an action sequence one year after they first saw it, there was correlation between the children's verbal skills at the time they first saw the event and their success on the later memory task.
However, even children with low verbal skills showed evidence of remembering the event; thus, memories may be facilitated by but are not dependent on those verbal skills.
