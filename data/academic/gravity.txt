Structures can be analyzed in terms of how they deal with downward forces created by gravity.
On the other hand, a comparatively warm body with a small surface gravity, like Earth's moon, is unable to hold even the heaviest gas and thus lacks an atmosphere.
The great height of Martian volcanoes is a direct consequence of the planet's low surface gravity.
The lower the gravity, the lesser the weight and the greater the height of the mountain.
It is no accident that Maxwell Mons on Venus and the Hawaiian shield volcanoes on Earth rise to about the same height (about 10 kilometers) above their respective bases-Earth and Venus have similar surface gravity.
Mars's surface gravity is only 40 percent that of Earth, so volcanoes rise roughly 2.5 times as high.
Because the surface of the water table is not flat but instead rises and falls with topography, groundwater is affected by gravity in the same fashion as surface water.
Under the force of gravity, the compression resulting from a collapse of the object must release energy.
Wright  s most dramatic residence, Fallingwater, has balconies that thrust far out over a stream in a way that seems to defy gravity.
Measurements of its gravity field tell us that the rock and metal sank to form a core about the size of our Moon, with a mantle and crust of ice floating above it.
But more likely the gravity of Jupiter is to blame for Ganymede's continuing geological activity.
