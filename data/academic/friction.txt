When not campaigning, soldiers needed to be occupied; otherwise they represented a potentially dangerous source of friction and disloyalty.
Wind movements are also modified in cities because buildings increase the friction on air flowing around them.
This friction tends to slow the speed of winds, making them far less efficient at dispersing pollutants.
