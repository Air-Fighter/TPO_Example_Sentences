Iron came from West Asia, although its routes of diffusion were somewhat different than those of agriculture.
The diffusion of agriculture and later of iron was accompanied by a great movement of people who may have carried these innovations.
Towns and cities were established not only as garrisons (military posts) but as centers for the diffusion of Greek language, literature, and thought, particularly through libraries, as at Antioch (in modern Turkey) and the most famous of all, at Alexandria in Egypt, which would be the finest in the world for the next thousand years.
Even the pores in the wall are filled with water, which almost stops the diffusion of gases.
