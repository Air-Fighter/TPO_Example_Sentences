They breathe through lungs, not through gills, and give birth to live young.
A completely different theory holds that yawning assists in the physical development of the lungs early in life, but has no remaining biological function in adults.
The lungs of a fetus secrete a liquid that mixes with its mother's amniotic fluid.
Babies with congenital blockages that prevent this fluid from escaping from their lungs are sometimes born with deformed lungs.
It might be that yawning helps to clear out the lungs by periodically lowering the pressure in them.
As the costs of shipbuilding rose, Venice clung to its outdated standard while the Dutch were innovation in the lighter and more easily handled ships.
The plates have edges that are spreading ridges (where two plates are moving apart and new seafloor is being created), subduction zones (where two plates collide and one plunges beneath the other),or transform faults(where two plates neither converge nor diverge but merely move past one another).It is at the boundaries between plates that most of Earth  s volcanism and earthquake activity occur.
It is known that they had lungs as well as gills for breathing.
These differences suggest a sadlike cavity below the front end of the gut that can only be interpreted as a lung.
Gills were undoubtedly the main source of oxygen for these fish, but the lungs served as an auxiliary breathing device for gulping air when the water became oxygen depleted, such as during extended periods of drought.
It should be emphasized that the evolution of lungs and limbs was in no sense an anticipation of future life on land.
Furthermore, they already had lungs, which rhipidistians presumably used for auxiliary breathing.
