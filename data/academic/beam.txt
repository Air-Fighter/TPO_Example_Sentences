As a method of spanning space, the arch can support greater weight than a horizontal beam.
Instead of light, the electron microscope uses a beam of electrons and has a much higher resolving power than the light microscope.
It uses an electron beam to scan the surface of a cell or group of cells that have been coated with metal.
The metal stops the beam from going through the cells.
When the metal is hit by the beam, it emits electrons.
Specimens are cut into extremely thin sections, and the transmission electron microscope aims an electron beam through a section, just as a light microscope aims a beam of light through a specimen.
The electromagnets bend the electron beam to magnify and focus an image onto a viewing screen or photographic film.
