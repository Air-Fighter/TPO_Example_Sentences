According to this theory, yawning in adults is just a developmental fossil with no biological function.
What factors are responsible for this developmental turning point?
Play appears to be a developmental characteristic of animals with fairly sophisticated nervous systems, mainly birds and mammals.
Most of these things are learned in the long developmental periods that primates have, during which they engage in countless play experiences with their peers. 
In fact, according to developmental psychologist David Elkind, United States society tends to push children so rapidly that they begin to feel tress and pressure at a young age.
