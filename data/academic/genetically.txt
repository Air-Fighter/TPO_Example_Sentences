Yet despite this synchronization of the period of the internal cycle, the animal's timer itself continues to have its own genetically built-in period close to, but different from, 24 hours.
Eventually the subpopulations become so genetically distinct that they cannot interbreed even if the physical barriers between them were removed.
Second, it appears that closely related populations of fishes on both sides of the isthmus are starting to genetically diverge from each other.
One question deals with the effects that Bt plants have on nontarget organisms such as beneficial insects, worms, and birds that consume the genetically engineered crop.
That leaves only the genetically resistant insects alive to perpetuate the population.
