Ecologists concluded that the apparent stability of climax ecosystems depended on their complexity.
This technological shift cause profound changes in the complexity of African societies.
They can do only so much to represent the full complexity of the global climate and hence may give only limited information about natural variability.
This considerable volume of intercommunity exchange brought a degree of social complexity in its wake.
No doubt the ability to talk about one's past represents memory of a different level of complexity than simple recognition or recall.
It has been estimated that Monte Testaccio contains the remains of some 53 million amphorae, in which around 6,000 million liters of oil were imported into the city from overseas, imports into imperial Rome were supported by the full might of the state and were therefore quite exceptional  but the size of the operations at Monte Testaccio, and the productivity and complexity that lay behind them, nonetheless cannot fail to impress.
The complexity of the microclimate is closely related to the complexity of structure in vegetation, and generally speaking, the more complex the structure of vegetation, the more speeds of animal are able to make a living there.
The high plant biomass of the tropics leads to a greater spatial complexity in the environment, and this leads to a higher potential for diversity in the living things that can occupy a region.
The change from redistribution to formal trade-often based on regulated commerce that perhaps involved fixed prices and even currency  was closely tied to growing political and social complexity and hence to the development of the state in the ancient world.
