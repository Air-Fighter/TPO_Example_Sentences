Detailed studies of the winds and currents using computer simulations suggest that drifting canoes would have been a most unlikely means of colonizing the Pacific.
Studies suggest that to date the variability in computer simulations is considerably smaller than in data obtained from the proxy records.
Recent measurements made in the field together with laboratory simulations offer a promising explanation of how this structure of charged particles forms.
