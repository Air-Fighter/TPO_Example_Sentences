What we do know is that as we include longer time intervals, the record shows increasing evidence of slow swings in climate between different regimes.
Cases in which many species become extinct within a geologically short interval of time are called mass extinctions.
When the elements known at the time were ordered by increasing atomic mass, it was found that successive elements belonged to different chemical groups and that the order of the groups in this sequence was fixed and repeated itself at regular intervals.
It soon became clear that there were multiple glacial ages during the Pleistocene, with warmer interglacial intervals between them.
In that study, each of eight different trilobite species was observed to undergo a gradual change in the number of segments    typically an increase of one or two segments over the whole time interval.
