Beyond that, the triumph of recorded sound has overshadowed the rich diversity of technological and aesthetic experiments with the visual image that were going forward simultaneously in the 1920s.
For example, if a uniformly moving pattern of some sort is passed across the visual field of a neonate (newborn), repetitive following movements of the eye occur.
With these sophisticated observational assessment and electro-physiological measures, we know that the neonate of only a few days is far more perceptive than previously suspected.
Some hypotheses fail to account for simultaneous extinctions on land and in the seas.
Rayleigh and Ramsay postulated the existence of a new group of elements, and in 1898 other members of the series (neon, krypton, and xenon) were isolated.
The male riflebird exploits both of these modes of signaling simultaneously in his courtship display.
The heterogeneous material of the drift (sand, clay, and rocks deposited there) convinced him of its glacial origin.
Petrifaction may also involve a simultaneous exchange of the original substance of a dead plant or animal with mineral matter of a different composition.
Igneous and metamorphic rocks are more compact, commonly crystalline, and rarely contain spaces between grains.
However, even igneous and metamorphic rocks may act as groundwater reservoirs if extensive fracturing occurs in such rocks and if the fracture system is interconnected.
It seems to have appeared in Italy and England (perhaps simultaneous invention) between 1275 and 1300.
The rural population both dispersed and grew, and was probably less homogeneous and more mobile than it hand been a generation earlier.
A growing body of evidence now suggests that all of the factors considered here are operating simultaneously to produce species succession.
