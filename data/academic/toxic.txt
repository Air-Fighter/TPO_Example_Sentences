While mineral deficiencies can limit the growth of plants, an overabundance of certain minerals can be toxic and can also limit growth.
Research has focused on the toxic effects of heavy metals such as lead, cadmium, mercury, and aluminum; however, even copper and zinc, which are essential elements, can become toxic in high concentrations.
Only recently have investigators considered using these plants to clean up soil and waste sites that have been contaminated by toxic levels of heavy metals Can environmentally friendly approach known as phytoremediation.
A harvest of the shoots would remove the toxic compounds off site to be burned or composted to recover the metal for industrial uses.
As an example, plants make chemicals toxic to fungal and bacterial parasites, along with ones toxic to predatory animals (sometimes they are the same chemicals).
In addition, water heated geothermally can contain salts and toxic materials dissolved from the hot rock.
Because they lack oxygen, marsh sediments are high in sulfides that are toxic to most plants.
This toxin can be concentrated in such filter-feeding organisms as clams and mussels, rendering them toxic to humans.
