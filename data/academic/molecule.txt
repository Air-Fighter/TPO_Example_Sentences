The algae capture the sun's energy by photosynthesis and store it in organic molecules.
Simply stated, a gas molecule can "evaporate" from a planet if it reaches a speed known as the escape velocity.
The residence time is the average length of time that any particular molecule of water remains in the lake, and it is calculated by dividing the volume of water in the lake by the rate at which water leaves the lake.
The residence time is an average; the time spent in the lake by a given molecule (if we could follow its fate) would depend on the route it took: it might flow through as part of the fastest, most direct current, or it might circle in a backwater for an indefinitely long time.
Again, the good storage and cell wall molecules of red and brown algae are different.
Each species of phytoplankton secretes or excretes organic molecules into the seawater.
However, cells, cellular organelles, and even molecules like DNA and protein are much larger than single atoms. 
Over time, the rising temperatures would have leveled off, solar ultraviolet radiation having broken down atmospheric water vapor molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.
