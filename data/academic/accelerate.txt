Desertification is accomplished primarily through the loss of stabilizing natural vegetation and the subsequent accelerated erosion of the soil by wind and water.
Water absorption is greatly reduced; consequently runoff is increased, resulting in accelerated erosion rates.
The process may be accelerated in subsequent decades if global warming resulting from air pollution seriously increases. 
This is usually followed by the drying of the soil and accelerated erosion. 
A positive side effect of this approach is that it accelerates the digestion of the prey consumed overnight, thus also accelerating growth.
With all the water vapor gone, the greenhouse effect would no longer have accelerated.
At present they are coming under a variety of threats, of which two of the most important are dredging and the effects of increased siltation brought about by accelerated erosion from neighboring land areas.
