One of the most difficult aspects of deciding whether current climatic events reveal evidence of the impact of human activities is that it is hard to get a measure of what constitutes the natural variability of the climate.
Instrumental records do not go back far enough to provide us with reliable measurements of global climatic variability on timescales longer than a century.
To the extent that the coverage of the global climate from these records can provide a measure of its true variability, it should at least indicate how all the natural causes of climate change have combined.
One way to estimate how all the various processes leading to climate variability will combine is by using computer models of the global climate.
They can do only so much to represent the full complexity of the global climate and hence may give only limited information about natural variability.
Studies suggest that to date the variability in computer simulations is considerably smaller than in data obtained from the proxy records.
In addition to the internal variability of the global climate system itself, there is the added factor of external influences, such as volcanoes and solar activity.
Some current analyses conclude that volcanoes and solar activity explain quite a considerable amount of the observed variability in the period from the seventeenth to the early twentieth centuries, but that they cannot be invoked to explain the rapid warming in recent decades.
Both of these, variability in responses and functional redundancy, could be thought of as insurance against disturbances.
