As the snow is deeper and lasts longer in the valleys, trees tend to attain greater heights on the ridges, even though they are more exposed to high-velocity winds and poor, thin soils there.
Wind velocity also increases with altitude and may cause serious stress for trees, as is made evident by the deformed shapes at high altitudes.
Simply stated, a gas molecule can "evaporate" from a planet if it reaches a speed known as the escape velocity.
For Earth, this velocity is 11 kilometers per second.
