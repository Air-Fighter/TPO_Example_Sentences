Wind velocity also increases with altitude and may cause serious stress for trees, as is made evident by the deformed shapes at high altitudes.
Simply stated, a gas molecule can "evaporate" from a planet if it reaches a speed known as the escape velocity.
For Earth, this velocity is 11 kilometers per second.
