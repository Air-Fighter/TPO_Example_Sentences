One question was related to evidence that the invertebrate fauna (animals without spines) of the Mediterranean had changed abruptly about 6 million years ago.
Increasing salinity caused by the evaporation resulted in the extermination of scores of invertebrate species.
Both of these conditions are often found on the ocean floors, where shelled invertebrates (organisms without spines) flourish and are covered by the continuous rain of sedimentary particles.
Indeed, unaltered shells of marine invertebrates are known from deposits over 100 million years old.
Insects and even small invertebrates have been found preserved in the hardened resins of conifers and certain other trees.
Many copepods (small, herbivorous crustaceans) and invertebrate larvae pick out selected phytoplankton species from mixed groups, changing the species composition.
