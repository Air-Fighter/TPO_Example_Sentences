Contrary to the arguments of some that much of the pacific was settled by Polynesians accidentally marooned after being lost and adrift, it seems reasonable that this feat was accomplished by deliberate colonization expeditions that set out fully stocked with food and domesticated plants and animals.
Gleason's arguments against climax and biome are largely valid against ecosystems as well.
Sometimes a closed question must be reopened as new evidence or new arguments based on old evidence come to light.
He makes this argument based on the anatomy of horse and bison, which do not have the ability to search for food through deep snow cover.
In contrast, Paul Colinvaux has offered a counterargument based on the analysis of pollen in lake sediments dating to the last ice age.
The argument seemed to be at a standstill until a number of recent studies resulted in a spectacular suite of new finds.
But this vegetation had a thin root mat with no soil formation, demonstrating that there was little long-term stability in plant cover, a finding supporting some of the arguments of Colinvaux.
