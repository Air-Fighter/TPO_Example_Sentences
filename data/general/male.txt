A male bird of paradise may put himself in the limelight by displaying his spectacular plumage in the best stage setting to attract a female.
The male riflebird exploits both of these modes of signaling simultaneously in his courtship display.
A male deer makes a buck rub by stripping the bark (outer layer) of a small tree with its antlers.
Adult male deer usually produce rubs in late summer or early autumn when the outervelvet layer is being shed from their antlers.
Rubs are created about one to two months before the breeding season (the rut).Hence for a long time biologists believed that male deer used buck rubs not only to clean and polish antlers but also to provide practice for the ensuing male-to-male combat during the rut.
A decade later another study reported that adult male white-tailed deer exhibited forehead rubbing just before and during the rut.
This forehead rubbing behavior coincides with a high level of glandular activity in the modified scent glands found on the foreheads of male deer; the glandular activity causes the forehead pelage (hairy covering) of adult males to be distinctly darker than in females or younger males.
Forehead rubbing by male deer on buck rubs presumably sends a great deal of information to other members of the same species.
Second, because only male deer rub, the buck rub and its associated chemicals indicate the sex of the deer producing the rub.
Pollen, a powdery substance, which is produced by flowering plants and contains male reproductive cells, is usually carried from plant to plant by insects or birds, but some plants rely on the wind to carry their pollen.
The worker and soldier castes of termites consist of both males and females, and the queen lives permanently with a male consort.
