However, most of its internal heat comes from the action of its muscles.
When researchers had one year olds imitate an action sequence one year after they first saw it, there was correlation between the children's verbal skills at the time they first saw the event and their success on the later memory task.
Without this muscular action, inhaling is like sucking air out of a balloon  the narrow passages tend to collapse.
In addition, breathing during REM depends much more on the action of the diaphragm and much less on rib cage action.
The action of natural selection in producing a small but highly significant step of evolution was seemingly demonstrated, with birds as the selecting force.
Last but not least of these considerations is the effort and resources required in this type of action, which need to be justified by evidence of the likely benefits. 
While the last of these possible causes remains speculative, define clues exist for the action of the first two causes.
The seagrass beds, in turn, dampen wave action, particularly if the blades reach the water surface.
The slowing of wave action and currents means that seagrass beds tend to accumulate sediment.
