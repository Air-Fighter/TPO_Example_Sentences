Large loggerhead and green turtles can maintain their body temperature at a degree or two above that of the surrounding water, and gigantothermy is probably the way they do it.
It operated by measuring the height of the Sun and the fixed stars: by calculating the angles created by these points, it determined the degree of latitude at which one stood (The problem of determining longitude, though, was not solved until the eighteenth century.)

An adaptation that is well developed in colonizing species is a high degree of variation in germination (the beginning of a seed  s growth).
While amphibians are poor thermoregulators, they do exercise control over their body temperature to a limited degree.
Their filtering systems, which reach such a high degree of development in shallow- water species, are greatly reduced.
