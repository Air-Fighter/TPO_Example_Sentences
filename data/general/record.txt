Extinct but already fully marine cetaceans are known from the fossil record.
Why does the fossil record not document the series of evolutionary changes during the evolution of animals?
Paleontologists continue to search the fossil record for answers to these questions.
At the end of the Cretaceous, the geological record shows that these seaways retreated from the continents back into the major ocean basins.
Many plants and animals disappear abruptly from the fossil record as one moves from layers of rock documenting the end of the Cretaceous up into rocks representing the beginning of the Cenozoic (the era after the Mesozoic).
What we do know is that as we include longer time intervals, the record shows increasing evidence of slow swings in climate between different regimes.
Over long periods of time, substances whose physical and chemical properties change with the ambient climate at the time can be deposited in a systematic way to provide a continuous record of changes in those properties overtime, sometimes for hundreds or thousands of years.
For example, the stronger the primary group ties of a sports team playing together, the better their record is.
Often the rapid and diffuse movements of the infant make it difficult to get an accurate record of the number of responses.
The fossil record shows at least five mass extinctions in which many families of marine organisms died out.
Ocean sediments presented a much more complete geologic record of the Pleistocene than continental glacial deposits did.
Furthermore, as the archaeological record shows, the state of health of agriculturalists was worse than that of their contemporary hunter-gatherers.
In the latter decades of the twentieth century there were intensified efforts to understand and record the abundance of Australian rock art.
The oceanic volcanic islands and their hot-spot trails are thus especially useful for geologists because they record the past locations of the plate over a fixed source.
The Saharan people left a remarkable record of their lives painted on the walls of caves deep in the desert.
Such changes are all but invisible over the short time scale of modern observations, and, it is argued, they are usually obscured by innumerable gaps in the imperfect fossil record.
The punctuated equilibrium hypothesis attempts to explain a curious feature of the fossil record    one that has been familiar to paleontologists for more than a century but has usually been ignored.
Many species appear to remain unchanged in the fossil record for millions of years    a situation that seems to be at odds with Darwin  s model of continuous change.
We find evidence of such extended events in the fossil record, which affords glimpses into the breakup of formerly continuous environments.
It was not until the Cambrian period, beginning about 600 million years ago, that a great proliferation of macroscopic species occurred on Earth and produced a fossil record that allows us to track the rise and fall of biodiversity.
It was not until the seventeenth century that attempts were made again to understand clues to Earth's history through the rock record.
After Hutton, geologists tried to determine rates of sedimentation so as to estimate the age of Earth from the total length of the sedimentary, or stratigraphic, record.
These underestimated the actual age by factors of 10 to 50 because much of the sedimentary record is missing in various locations and because there is a long rock sequence that is older than half a billion years that is far less well defined in terms of fossils and less well preserved.
Now and then these files include pieces of writing that are of a distinctly different order, writings that do not merely record some matter of fact but involve creative intellectual activity.
