This is particularly true for trees in the middle and upper latitudes, which tend to attain greater heights on ridges, whereas in the tropics the trees reach their greater heights in the valleys.
As the snow is deeper and lasts longer in the valleys, trees tend to attain greater heights on the ridges, even though they are more exposed to high-velocity winds and poor, thin soils there.
Individual fish may be replaced, but the number of fish will tend to be the same from one year to the next.
Both oil and gas are less dense than water, so they generally tend to rise upward through water-saturated rock and sediment. 
Adults' memories of the next few years also tend to be scanty.
Right-handers tend to have longer, stronger, and more muscular bones on the right side, and Marcellin Boule as long ago as 1911 noted the La Chapelle-aux-Saints Neanderthal skeleton had a right upper arm bone that was noticeably stronger than the left.
Right-handed soldiers tend to be wounded on the left.
That is, while there does tend to be a rainy season from May to October, there is also a dry season from January through April.
Less colorful birds and animals that inhabit the rain forest tend to rely on other forms of signaling other than the visual, particularly over long distances.
Equally perplexing constituents of Allende are the refractory inclusions: irregular white masses that tend to be larger than chondrules.
These are the elements that tend to form gases even at very low temperatures.
Thus, city surfaces, as well as the air above them, tend to be drier between episodes of rain; with little water available for the cooling process of evaporation, relative humidities are usually lower.
Some of the muscles that help keep the upper airway open when breathing tend to become more relaxed during sleep, especially during REM (the phase of sleep in which there is rapid eye movement).
Without this muscular action, inhaling is like sucking air out of a balloon  the narrow passages tend to collapse.
Competing species also tend to change their ranges so that their territories no longer overlap.
Whereas parents in China tend to see preschools primarily as a way of giving children a good start academically, Japanese parents view them primarily as a way of giving children the opportunity to be members of a group.
Although graduates of Head Start programs tend to show immediate IQ gains, these increases do lot last.
Sandy soils are prone to the leaching of nutrients and minerals and so tend to be nutritionally poor.
Pioneer species--- those that occur only in the earliest stages of colonization--- tend to have high rates of invasion because they produce very large numbers of reproductive propagules (seeds, spores, and so on) and because they have an efficient means of dispersal (normally, wind).
In fact, this is the time of year they traditionally set aside to tend to their equipment and await the return of cold water.
Seagrass meadows in relatively turbulent waters tend to form a mosaic of individual mounds, whereas meadows in relatively calm waters tend to form flat, extensive carpets.
The slowing of wave action and currents means that seagrass beds tend to accumulate sediment.
Seagrass beds under the influence of strong currents tend to have many of the lighter particles, including seagrass debris, moved out, whereas beds in weak current areas accumulate lighter detrital material.
In a similar way, trees in temperate forests that are insect pollinated tend to grow as solitary, widely spread individuals.
Small grains may be blown farther but they are also more prone to be whisked past the waiting stigma because smaller particles tend to stay trapped in the fast-moving air that flows around the stigma.
It is usually claimed that species-rich ecosystems tend to be more stable than species-poor ecosystems.
This process helps explain why both tend to be more frequent over cities.
If there are major industrial areas along the outskirts, pollutants are carried into the heat of town, where they tend to concentrate.
