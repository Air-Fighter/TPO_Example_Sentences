Species of birch, for example, may occur at the timberline in parts of the Himalayas.
The highest plants in the world occur at around 6,100 meters on Makalu in the Himalayas.
Why did it occur so late in the history of Earth?
Fossilization of soft-bodied animals is less likely than fossilization of hard-bodied animals, but it does occur.
Some fossils endured through so many millions of years that they appear in many strata, but others occur only in a few strata, and a few species had their births and extinctions within one particular stratum.
While such repression may occur, people cannot remember ordinary events from the infant and toddler periods either.
Why did the near extinction and migrations occur?
While these records provide broadly consistent indications that temperature variations can occur on a global scale, there are nonetheless some intriguing differences, which suggest that the pattern of temperature variations in regional climates can also differ significantly from each other.
These critics were making a common assumption  that the technological inadequacies of earlier efforts (poor synchronization, weak sound amplification, fragile sound recordings) would invariably occur again.
For example, if a uniformly moving pattern of some sort is passed across the visual field of a neonate (newborn), repetitive following movements of the eye occur.
In contrast, should another ice age occur, sea level would drop drastically.
The data showed that yawning tended to occur about 15 minutes before a period of increased behavioral activity.
They occur primarily in regions of recent volcanic activity as hot, dry rock; natural hot water; or natural steam.
improvements in memory seem to occur.
The same minerals that occur in refractory inclusions are believed to be the earliest-formed substances to have condensed out of the solar nebula.
Two things result from these changes in breathing control that occur during sleep.
Additional breathing changes occur during REM sleep that are even more dramatic than the changes that occur during NREM.
This was to occur with progress in the development of the steam engine.
The plates have edges that are spreading ridges (where two plates are moving apart and new seafloor is being created), subduction zones (where two plates collide and one plunges beneath the other),or transform faults(where two plates neither converge nor diverge but merely move past one another).It is at the boundaries between plates that most of Earth  s volcanism and earthquake activity occur.
How can volcanic activity occur so far from a plate boundary?
Most volcanoes that occur in the interiors of plates are believed to be produced by mantle plumes, columns of molten rock that rise from deep within the mantle.
Its numbers fall tenfold to thirty in a typical cycle, and a hundredfold change can occur.
But it may also occur among totally unrelated forms that compete for the same resource, such as seed-eating rodents and ants.
Competition may occur for any needed resource.
If it seems difficult to conceive how major changes could occur rapidly, consider this: An alteration of a single gene in flies is enough to turn a normal fly with a single pair of wings into one that has two pairs of wings.
The question about the rate of evolution must now be turned around: does evolution ever proceed gradually, or does it always occur in short bursts?
They occur on a wide range of soil types and in extremes of climate.
Some savannas occur on wet, waterlogged soils; others on dry, sandy, well-drained soils.
Waterlogged soils occur in areas that are flat or have poor drainage.
Experiments suggest that if fire did not occur in savannas in the Americas, species composition would change significantly.
Pioneer species--- those that occur only in the earliest stages of colonization--- tend to have high rates of invasion because they produce very large numbers of reproductive propagules (seeds, spores, and so on) and because they have an efficient means of dispersal (normally, wind).
Aggressive species usually forage in groups and feed mainly on flowers that occur in high-density clumps.
These plants usually occur where ants are abundant, most in the tropics but some in temperate areas.
These vitamins are produced only by another species; hence, a succession of species could occur whereby first the vitamin-producing species is present and then the vitamin-requiring species follows.
They occur in each of the 49 states of the continental United States.
This scenario is not likely to occur in many instances because there are no weedy relatives growing near the crop plant.
We know that evolution will occur when transgenic plants grown on a large scale over a period of time.
When oceanic islands are far enough apart to permit populations to evolve in isolation, but dose enough to allow occasional dispersions to occur, they are effectively outdoor laboratories of evolution.
The species on the Galapagos Islands today, most of which occur nowhere else, descended from organisms that floated, flew, or were blown over the sea from the South American mainland.
A complex sequence of chemical reactions is involved in converting the original solid organic matter to oil and gas, and additional chemical changes may occur in the oil and gas even after they have formed.
