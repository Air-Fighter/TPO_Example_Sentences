Genetic engineering also may provide a partial solution, as new strains of drought-resistant crops continue to be developed.
Aeroponics, a technique in which plants are suspended and the roots misted with a nutrient solution, is another method for growing plants without soil.
These problems needed still another solution, and the ingredients for it lay close at hand.
The solution is to allow the flippers to cool down without drawing heat away from the rest of the turtle  s body.
It was argued that once hunter-gatherers had occupied the whole world, the population started to grow everywhere and food became scarce; agriculture would have been a solution to this problem.
Once humans possessed such a mind, they were able to find an imaginative solution to a situation of severe economic crisis such as the farming dilemma described earlier.
On land, the supportive buoyancy of water is missing, the plant is no longer bathed in a nutrient solution, and air tends to dry things out.
Another solution for such animals is to forage in particular layers of water where the particles may be more concentrated.
