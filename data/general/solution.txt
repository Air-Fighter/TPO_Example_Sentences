Genetic engineering also may provide a partial solution, as new strains of drought-resistant crops continue to be developed.
Much of the research on nutrient deficiencies is based on growing plants hydroponically, that is, in soilless liquid nutrient solutions.
This technique allows researchers to create solutions that selectively omit certain nutrients and then observe the resulting effects on the plants.
Aeroponics, a technique in which plants are suspended and the roots misted with a nutrient solution, is another method for growing plants without soil.
These problems needed still another solution, and the ingredients for it lay close at hand.
The solution is to allow the flippers to cool down without drawing heat away from the rest of the turtle  s body.
The empty shell of a snail or clam may be left behind, and if it is sufficiently durable and resistant to dissolution, it may remain basically unchanged for a long period of time.
This process is termed "replacement" because solutions have dissolved the original material and replaced it with an equal volume of the new substance.
It was argued that once hunter-gatherers had occupied the whole world, the population started to grow everywhere and food became scarce; agriculture would have been a solution to this problem.
Once humans possessed such a mind, they were able to find an imaginative solution to a situation of severe economic crisis such as the farming dilemma described earlier.
On land, the supportive buoyancy of water is missing, the plant is no longer bathed in a nutrient solution, and air tends to dry things out.
Another solution for such animals is to forage in particular layers of water where the particles may be more concentrated.
This finer level of resolution requires direct fossil evidence of dinosaur meals.
