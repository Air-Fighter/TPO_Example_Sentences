So, in another set of experiments, Kramer put identical food boxes around the cage, with food in only one of the boxes.
The boxes were stationary, and the one containing food was always at the same point of the compass.
As long as the birds could see the Sun, no matter how their surroundings were altered, they went directly to the correct food box.
