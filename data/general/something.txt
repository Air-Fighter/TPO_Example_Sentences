In the few cases where an Ice Age figure is depicted holding something, it is mostly, though not always, in the right hand.

Changes in climate during the Devonian may have had something to do with this if freshwater areas became progressively more restricted.
If, with greater caution, we assume lower totals in the early eighteenth century and only 400 million in 1850, we still face a startling fact: something like a doubling of the vast Chinese population in the century before Western contact, foreign trade, and industrialization could have had much effect.
