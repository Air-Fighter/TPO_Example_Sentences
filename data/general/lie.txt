The proposed areas of the domestication of African crops lie in a band that extends from Ethiopia across southern Sudan to West Africa.
They could travel through the air, float in water, and lie dormant for many months. 
These rivers and river systems are known as "exogenous" because their sources lie outside the arid zone.
The seeds then lie dormant until the next wet year, when the desert blooms again.
The jaw joints of many advanced herbivores, such as cows, lie at a different level than the tooth row, allowing transverse tearing, shredding, and compression of plant material.
In the majority of cases, the beaches lie at a higher level because the land has been raised up through isostatic uplift or tectonic movement.
