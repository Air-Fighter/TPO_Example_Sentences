A primary group involves two or more people who enjoy a direct, intimate, cohesive relationship with one another.

Sometimes primary group relationships evolve out of secondary group relationships.
First, group size is important.
And third, the probability that we will develop primary group bonds increases as we have frequent and continuous contact.

However, no group or species can maintain its dominance indefinitely, and when, after over 200 million years, the age of dinosaurs came to a dramatic end about 65 million years ago, mammals began to flourish, evolving from relatively few types of small terrestrial animals into the myriad of diverse species, including bats and whales, that we know today.
