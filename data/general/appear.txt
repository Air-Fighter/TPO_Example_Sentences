During the early stages of its development, a society becomes aware of forces that appear to influence or control its food supply and well-being.
In the tropics, the valleys appear to be more favorable because they are less prone to dry out, they have less frost, and they have deeper soils.
Some of those slabs appear to have been painted as much as 28,000 years ago, which suggests that painting in Africa is as old as painting in Europe.
Some fossils endured through so many millions of years that they appear in many strata, but others occur only in a few strata, and a few species had their births and extinctions within one particular stratum.
Not only could Smith identify rock strata by the fossils they contained, he could also see a pattern emerging: certain fossils always appear in more ancient sediments, while others begin to be seen as the strata become more recent.
They appear only in equatorial regions and generally do not form extensive interconnected networks.
There appear to be many unexplored matters about the motivation to reflect  C for example, the value of externally motivated reflection as opposed to that of teachers who might reflect by habit.

Light-loving species are always among the first invaders, while shade-tolerant species appear later in the succession.
It would appear that the instability of the climatic conditions led populations that had originally been nomadic to settle down and develop a sedentary style of life, which led in turn to population growth and to the need to increase the amount of food available.
The frequency with which certain simple motifs appear in these oldest sites has led rock-art researchers to adopt a descriptive term  the Panaramitee style  a label which takes its name from the extensive rock pavements at Panaramitee North in desert South Australia, which are covered with motifs pecked into the surface.
At first sight, the plain did not appear to be a likely home for a civilization.
When rolled over a soft material---primarily the clay of bullae (round seals), tablets, or clay lumps attached to boxes, jars, or door bolts---the scene would appear in relief, easily legible.
Population cycles are characteristic of small mammals, and they sometimes appear to be brought about by predators.
Two factors appear to be generating the cycle: food plants and predators.
Many species appear to remain unchanged in the fossil record for millions of years    a situation that seems to be at odds with Darwin  s model of continuous change.
Provincial police began to appear, along with district officers and cattle registration and land deeds and registration for compulsory military service.
Bees did not appear to be injured in these fights, which were apparently ritualized.
Climatic conditions in New Zealand appear to have been relatively stable over the period during which moa became extinct.
Even more alarming is the fact that they appear to be getting stronger.
Writing, it would appear, started as a primitive form of bookkeeping.
Study of coprolites has indicated that the diets of some herbivorous dinosaurs were relatively diverse, while other dinosaurs appear to have been specialists, feeding on particular types of plants.
