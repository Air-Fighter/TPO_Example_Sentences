We need therefore to know how much the climate can vary of its own accord in order to interpret with confidence the extent to which recent changes are natural as opposed to being the result of human activities.
By doing so, they could possibly secure more food, which should result in more rapid growth or larger size, either of which is advantageous.
As a result, its activities are shifted relative to the external cycle of the new environment.

As a result, pastoralists, like carnivores in general, occupy a higher position on the food chain.
As a result, glaciers create a great variety of landforms that remain long after the surface is released from its icy covering.
The growth of independent guilds was furthered by the fact that surplus was not a result of domestic craft production but resulted primarily from international trading; the government left working people to govern themselves, much as shepherds of tribal confederacies were left alone by their leaders.
The result is a forked lightning that strikes the ground in two places.
As a result, many Americans were an inveterately restless, rootless, and ambitious people.

The result has been that the residence time of one of the lakes increased from 5 to 18 years during the study period.
Two things result from these changes in breathing control that occur during sleep.
None of these volcanoes was formed as a result of collisions between plates of the Martian crust-there is no plate motion on Mars.
Martian craters are surrounded by ejecta (debris formed as a result of an impact) that looks quite different from its lunar counterparts.
A major development was the discovery, again about 3000 B.C.E., that if copper, which had been known in Mesopotamia since about 3500 B.C.E., was mixed with tin, a much harder metal, bronze, would result.
But a small segment of the urban society started to specialize in nonagricultural tasks as a result of the city  s role as a regional center.
Early in the Uruk period, the use of undecorated utilitarian pottery was probably the result of specialized mass production.
Then in 1963, in the early days of the development of the theory of plate tectonics, Canadian geophysicist Tuzo Wilson realized that this age progression could result if the islands were formed on a surface plate moving over a fixed volcanic source in the interior.
As a result, cattle and humans came into close association.
The result was the extermination of a large fraction of the South American mammals, which were apparently unable to withstand the competition from invading North American species  although added predation was also an important factor.
The effect on the well-being and existence of a species is just the result of the effects of selection on all the individuals of the species.
Thus species selection is actually a result of individual selection.
The growth of the electric-power industry was the result of a remarkable series of scientific discoveries and developments in electrotechnology during the nineteenth century, but significant changes in what we might now call hydro (water) technology also played their part.
Sun clocks worked, of course, only on clear days; water clocks misbehaved when the temperature fell toward freezing, to say nothing of long-run drift as the result of sedimentation and clogging.
The result was relentless pressure to improve technique and design.
First, at least some of the observed differences between the enzymes of the Atlantic and Pacific fish populations were not random but were the result of evolutionary adaptation.
This growth was achieve as the result of the collective decisions of thousands of peasants families to expand the amount of land they cultivated, clear and plant new land, or adopt more intensive methods of agriculture.
Their high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets result in low body-fat levels, which are commonly associated with low fertility in women.
As a result, the soil is aerated broken up, fertilized, and brought to the surface, hastening soil development. 
As a result, the scribes were assigned their own goddess, Nisaba, later replaced by the god Nabu of Borsippa, whose symbol is neither weapon nor dragon but something far more fearsome, the cuneiform stick. 
As a result, many natural ponderosa pine forests have a parklike appearance, with low fuel loads, big trees spaced apart, and a relatively clear understory.
Additionally, in many speeds the tolerance boundaries are flexible and can change as a result of acclimatization (long-term exposure to particular conditions).
The younger terrain is the result of tectonic and volcanic forces.
These are at best a waste and at worst an impediment to the transfer of pollen in the air The result is insignificant-looking flowers and catkins (dense cylindrical clusters of small, petalless flowers).
To put this result in more general terms, a species-rich ecosystem may be more stable because it is more likely to have species with a wide array of responses to variable conditions such as droughts.
One result was an influx of craft worker, particularly those skilled in artistic media like stone-carving which had not existed before the conquest.
An increasingly larger portion of the stepped-up commercial activity was the result of trade with overseas colonies.
As a result, many small, independent farmers were forced to sell out simply because they could not compete.
