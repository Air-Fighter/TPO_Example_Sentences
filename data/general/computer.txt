Detailed studies of the winds and currents using computer simulations suggest that drifting canoes would have been a most unlikely means of colonizing the Pacific.
A computer-generated view of the Martian north polar region shows the extent of what may have been an ancient ocean covering much of the northern lowlands.
One way to estimate how all the various processes leading to climate variability will combine is by using computer models of the global climate.
Studies suggest that to date the variability in computer simulations is considerably smaller than in data obtained from the proxy records.
Furthermore, the number of interactions is so great that they are difficult to analyze, even with the help of large computers.
According to computerized climate models, global temperatures fell to near the freezing point, photosynthesis halted, and most plants on land and in the sea died.
Clearly, this is a complex issue that requires further field research with a broad spectrum of ecosystems and species: grassland plants and computer models will only take us so far.
