Detailed studies of the winds and currents using computer simulations suggest that drifting canoes would have been a most unlikely means of colonizing the Pacific.
One way to estimate how all the various processes leading to climate variability will combine is by using computer models of the global climate.
Studies suggest that to date the variability in computer simulations is considerably smaller than in data obtained from the proxy records.
Clearly, this is a complex issue that requires further field research with a broad spectrum of ecosystems and species: grassland plants and computer models will only take us so far.
