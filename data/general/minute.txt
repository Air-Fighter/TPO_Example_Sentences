Consolidated (or cemented) sediments, too, contain millions of minute water-holding pores.
Even a fifteen-minute burst of light in otherwise sustained darkness can reset an animal's circadian rhythm.
The data showed that yawning tended to occur about 15 minutes before a period of increased behavioral activity.
The daguerreotype was a unique image that reproduced what was in front of the camera lens in minute, unselective detail and could not be duplicated.
Study of the textures of chondrules confirms that they cooled rather quickly, in times measured in minutes or hours, so the heating events that formed them must have been localized.
However, detailed studies of the chondrite matrix suggest that much of it, too, has been formed by condensation or melting in the nebula, although minute amounts of surviving interstellar dust are mixed with the processed materials.
Phytoplankton are minute, free-floating aquatic plants.
Although each cell secretes a minute amount of toxin, the massive dinoflagellate numbers cause the toxin to reach concentrations that kill many creatures.
