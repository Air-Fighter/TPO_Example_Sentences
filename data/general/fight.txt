For the price of 25 cents (or 5 cents per machine), customers moved from machine to machine to watch five different films (or, in the case of famous prizefights, successive rounds of a single fight).
One of the problems is providing a clear definition of play is that it involves the same behaviors that take place in other circumstances---dominance, predation, competition, and real fighting.
Though these bees do no sting, rival colonies of some species fight fiercely over potential nesting sites.
If workers from two different colonies arrive at the prospective nest at the same time, they may fight for possession.
Bees did not appear to be injured in these fights, which were apparently ritualized.
While this contest over an unoccupied nest site produced no obvious mortality, fights over occupied nests sometimes kill over 1,000 bees in a single battle. 
Firefighters became much more successful at achieving that goal after 1945, thanks to improved firefighting technology.
