At the end of the Cretaceous, the geological record shows that these seaways retreated from the continents back into the major ocean basins.
Critics also point out that the shallow seaways had retreated from and advanced on the continents numerous times during the Mesozoic, so why did the dinosaurs survive the climatic changes associated with the earlier fluctuations but not with this one?
He persuasively argued that such an ice-free corridor did not exist until much later, when the continental ice began its final retreat. 
These soils were evidence that the glaciers retreated as the climate warmed.
Ice sheets retreated and sea levels rose.
However, as the climate dried up, the forests retreated from the vicinity of the settlement.
The calotype was revolutionary in its use of chemically treated paper in which areas hit by light became dark in tone, producing a negative image.
This "negative," as Talbot called it, could then be used to print multiple positive images on another piece of treated paper.
Because the medium was so prolific, in the sense that it was possible to produce a multitude of images very cheaply, it was soon treated as the poor relation of fine art, rather than its destined successor.
Animals also have to adapt to desert conditions, and they may do it through two forms of behavioral adaptation: they either escape or retreat.
The term retreat is applied to the short-term escape behavior of desert animals, and it usually assumes the pattern of a daily rhythm.
When the glaciers retreated, the separated populations of plants and animals came into contact again.
The villages became more vulnerable to arbitrary treatment by government bureaucrats as local elites now hand less control over them.
Between 200 B.C and A.D 300, this was supplemented by vellum, calf skin treated and then smoothed by pumice stone.
