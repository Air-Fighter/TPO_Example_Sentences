In the few cases where an Ice Age figure is depicted holding something, it is mostly, though not always, in the right hand.
In 1929 the United States motion picture industry released more than 300 sound films  a rough figure, since a number were silent films with music tracks, or films prepared in dual versions, to take account of the many cinemas not yet wired for sound.
Two percent may be a deceiving figure, however, since over 80 percent of the world  s freshwater is locked up as ice in glaciers, with the majority of it in Antarctica.
This was probably a large increase over the figure even two or three decades earlier, during the late 1800s.
